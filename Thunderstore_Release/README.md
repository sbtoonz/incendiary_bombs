Have stumbled across a new way to utilize the surtling cores. I have found that if you bind them with ancient bark a bit of iron, and apply some fire they will explode. 

## Incendiary Bombs:
These seem to be the normal explosive devices I have discovered. It is lit upon being thrown and will explode a few seconds later. Sometimes it does burn the grass up

## Sticky Bombs:
If you apply sap to these devices they stick quite well to anything they are thrown at. It helps direct the blast quite well.
